First repository

Hello guys !

My name is Lucas Militão,a.k.a as Militão,and I am currently doing my master study in Mechanical Engineering and I simply love programming. The reason I decided to get into GitHub was to be able to get some support for a genetic algorithm that I am developing in Python.

I am new to the programming language and I know only C programming,so that is why I won't be able to help you guys a lot right now,but I expect to be able to do so in the future.
